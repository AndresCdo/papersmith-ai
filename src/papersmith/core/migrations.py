"""Artifact migrations: what a release changes beyond the files it ships.

``upgrade`` synchronizes framework FILES and preserves research state by not
touching it. That holds only while the shape of an artifact never changes. This
module carries a workspace's own artifacts — graph state, derived indices,
scaffolded topology — to the installed release's expectations, so the version a
workspace records is a claim about its artifacts and not only about its skills
tree.

Two kinds of migration share one mechanism:

* A **version-gated** migration (``applies_from`` set) is a shape change
  between releases. It runs once, when the workspace sits below the gate and
  the installed kit sits at or above it, and the applied ledger keeps it from
  running again.
* A **convergence** migration (``applies_from`` is ``None``) makes the
  workspace match the installed release regardless of its history. It is
  evaluated on every upgrade and is never recorded as finished, because the
  next release can change what there is to converge to. Its :meth:`Migration.
  plan` is a probe, so an already-satisfied workspace yields no actions and
  nothing is written.

Nothing here decides whether to write ``.papersmith/version``; ``upgrade`` owns
that, and it is the ordering that makes the whole thing honest — see
:func:`upgrade.upgrade`.
