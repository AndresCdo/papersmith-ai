"""Every skill description fits the ceiling the runtime that reads it enforces.

Pi validates a skill's `description` against the Agent Skills spec and caps it
at `MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH = 1024` (`dist/core/skills.js:11`). Past the cap Pi
warns and loads the skill anyway, so nothing fails and the excess simply lives
on -- which is how two descriptions came to sit at 1680 and 1814 units while
every suite stayed green.

The unit is the one JS `length` counts: UTF-16 code units. Measuring in Python
characters would call a description legal that the runtime measures as over,
which is the whole difference the guard exists to catch.
