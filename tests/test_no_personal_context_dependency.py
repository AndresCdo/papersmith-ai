"""The verification path carries no dependency on the operator's personal context.

**Why this exists, and what it cost to learn.** A suite that passes on the
machine that happens to have a memory provider installed proves nothing about
the machine that does not. This repository had exactly that shape: the canonical
context every harness entrypoint routes to declared an artifact store that named
a provider, and nothing checked it. The measured evidence is in
`openspec/changes/archive/`: twelve changes declared the memory-only `engram`
store, and when the provider was absent their artifacts landed in "a session
scratchpad ... that does not survive the session"
(`2026-08-21-the-pin-the-runner-can-actually-fetch/archive-report.md:9,355`).

**The load-bearing control is not in this file.** `scripts/clean_context_gate.py`
runs the declared gate under an empty `HOME` and under one carrying the shapes a
developer's machine has (`.pi/agent`, `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`,
`.engram`), and fails if the two disagree. That is the control that can detect a
personal context dependency, because it observes behavior. The rules below are a
regression lock over the declarations and calls that are legible statically —
they narrow the surface, they do not close it. A future document could require a
provider in prose no pattern here parses; the differential control is what
catches the consequence.

**Rule B passes before and after this feature's edits**, because the tracked tree
holds zero provider calls. That is stated rather than hidden: it is a lock
against a future call, not evidence that the provider-absent path was exercised.
