"""Debounced filesystem watching and a thread-safe SSE broadcast bus.

The watcher is deliberately narrow: it watches the directories that carry
paper state (``sections/``, ``openspec/``, ``experiments/`` and
``papersmith.yaml``), ignores build and VCS noise, and coalesces a burst of
writes into one 300 ms flush so a single editor save does not fan out into a
dozen recomputations.

The bus lets the watcher thread publish into asyncio queues owned by the
server's SSE subscribers without reaching into their event loop directly.
