"""Run the declared gate twice under different personal contexts, and refuse to
call the two results equal unless they are.

**Why a differential, and not a flag.** The first version of this control pointed
`ENGRAM_BIN` at a nonexistent path and unset `ENGRAM_URL`, then re-ran the gate
and required "the same result as with the provider present". It could not fail:
nothing in the tracked tree reads either variable, and the gate spawns no agent,
so both runs were identical by construction. A control that cannot fail is worse
than no control, because it is read as evidence.

**What this does instead.** The declared gate runs under two `HOME`s that differ
only in the personal agent context they contain:

* an **empty** home — a bare `mktemp -d`;
* a **decoy** home — the same, populated with the shapes a developer's machine
  carries: `.pi/agent/settings.json`, `.pi/agent/mcp.json`, `.agents/skills/`,
  `.claude/skills/`, `.config/opencode/`, `.engram/`.

If any part of the gate reads the operator's personal context, the two runs
differ, and this script exits non-zero naming the difference. If none does, the
two runs agree and the property holds.

**Both homes are synthetic, which is the point.** Comparing "the operator's real
home" against "an empty one" would be trivially green on CI, where the home is
already bare. A decoy is present on every machine, so the control fires
everywhere: a test that reads `~/.pi` or `~/.agents` fails here on a laptop and
on a runner alike.

**Cost.** The declared gate runs twice. That is the price of a control that can
fail, and it is paid deliberately.
